  hadlais: blatherversity: [x] Sea Slicks Whenever there is an oil spill in the
  world's oceans, a sea slick is "born". Countless animals lose their lives to
  the thick, clinging clutches of oil, dying miserable, wretchedly drawn-out
  deaths. Sea slicks are born of the lost souls of those animals and the sludge
  that bound and choked the life from them.
